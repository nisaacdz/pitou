**Task: Design the Drive Display Section for a File Explorer UI (HTML & CSS)**

We're building a file explorer app, and you're tasked with designing the section that displays information about available drives. This section will be a single `div` container with a user-friendly layout.

**Functionality:**

* The `div` container should display information for each available drive on the user's device.
* Each drive information section should include:
    * Drive Name (e.g., "C:" or "My Hard Drive")
    * Drive Letter (e.g., "C" or "D")
    * A visual gauge bar representing used space (red for used space, remaining space can be left uncolored)

**Design Requirements:**

* Use flexbox to create a layout that allows the `div` to expand and accommodate additional drives if they are connected.
* Use clear and concise HTML structure to represent each drive's information.
* Style the `div` and its content with CSS for a visually appealing and informative presentation.
* Assume the rest of the UI will blend seamlessly with the styles you create for this section.

**Focus:**

For now, we can disregard responsiveness (adapting to different screen sizes). We'll focus on a basic layout that functions well.

**Additional Information:**

* You don't need to worry about retrieving drive information from the system. Assume a function called `get_drives()` will provide a list of objects containing drive details.
* Feel free to use any reasonable HTML elements and CSS properties to achieve the desired layout and styling.

**Deliverables:**

* Provide the HTML code for the `div` container and its child elements representing each drive's information.
* Provide the corresponding CSS code for styling the container, drive information sections, and the gauge bar.

I hope this clarifies the task for your subordinate. Feel free to answer any further questions they might have about the functionality or desired layout.
